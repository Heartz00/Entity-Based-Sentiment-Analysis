# Entity-Based-Sentiment-Analysis
A project that explores further into the possible worthy information that can be formed from a deeper analysis and interpretation of textual data. 
An entitty based sentiment analysis model was implemented which not only identifies the sentiments attached to each textual data e.g customer reviews , but also goes deeper by identifying relevant entities in a review and attaches the corresponding sentiment to the entities.

A pre trained model, BERT  was used to predict the contextual sentiment of the entities extracted from the Amazon reviews. The extraction was doing using SpaCy.
